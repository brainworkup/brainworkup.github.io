# Quarto and FrontMatter

This is a test post to see how Quarto handles FrontMatter.

## FrontMatter

FrontMatter is a YAML block at the top of a file that contains metadata about
the file. It is used by many static site generators to provide information about
the file, such as the title, date, tags, categories, etc.
